Routing in Express js 
Routing is a mechanism that determines how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Middleware in Express js
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

We can set a middleware using use method of express object.

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});


Error handling in Express js:
This is the default error handeler in express js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
